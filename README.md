# Jamaica Street Artists static Bootstrap site

This is the static version of the Jamaica Street Artists site before I convert it to a Wordpress theme.

* This will be using Bootstrap as a base to save time.

* I have set up SASS using gulp to better organise my CSS.

* This site will eventually be converted into a Wordpress theme, I learnt this process through a great Udemy tutorial.
