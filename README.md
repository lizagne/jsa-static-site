# Jamaica Street Artists static Bootstrap site - (WIP)

This is the static version of the Jamaica Street Artists site before I convert it to a Wordpress theme.

* This will be using Bootstrap as a base to save time.

* I have set up SASS using gulp to better organise my CSS.

* This site will eventually be converted into a Wordpress theme using Underscores base theme, I learnt this process through a great Udemy tutorial.

Things still TODO:
  - Finish About, Artists, Contact page
  - Create custom post types for the artists on homepage so that the client can add and delete their own
  - Find a way to include all artists and links into the header so that it's fair!
  - Catch up with Client in the new year to talk about what else is needed
